### Bootcamp Update
<i>Published on 07/10/2019</i>

Throughout September and October the IoC in conjunction with Digital Union are running a bootcamp here at University of Sunderland to help grads and current undergrads/masters students get to grips with what skills industry are looking for right now.

The teams are busy trying to implement a serverless architecture to deliver a solution for Newcastle based NBS (a technology platform for the construction industry). 

The tech stack is looking like this:

Python 3.7<br/> 
Serverless framework (AWS Lambda)<br/> 
Dynamo DB<br/> 

Most of the guys have not used ANY of this stuff and so it is a HUGE learning curve for them but they are going all out and pushing their abilities.

More updates to follow...
